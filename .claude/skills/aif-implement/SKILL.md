# Implement - Execute Task Plan

Execute tasks from the plan, track progress, and enable session continuation.

## Workflow

### Step 0: Check Current State

**FIRST:** Determine what state we're in:

```
1. Check for uncommitted changes (git status)
2. Check for plan files in .ai-factory/plans/
3. Check current branch
```

**If uncommitted changes exist:**
```
You have uncommitted changes. Commit them first with /aif-commit before continuing.
```

**If NO plan file exists (all tasks completed or fresh start):**

```
No active plan found.
Checked: .ai-factory/plans/<branch>.md, .ai-factory/plans/*.md

Current branch: feature/user-auth

What would you like to do?
- [ ] Start new feature from current branch
- [ ] Return to main/master and start new feature
- [ ] Create quick task plan (no branch)
- [ ] Nothing, just checking status
```

Based on choice:
- New feature from current → `/aif-plan full <description>`
- Return to main → switch branches manually, then `/aif-plan full <description>`
- Quick task → `/aif-plan fast <description>`

**If plan file exists → continue to Step 0.1**

### Step 0.1: Load Project Context & Past Experience

**Read `.ai-factory/DESCRIPTION.md`** if it exists to understand:
- Tech stack (language, framework, database, ORM)
- Project architecture and conventions
- Non-functional requirements

**Read `.ai-factory/ARCHITECTURE.md`** if it exists to understand:
- Chosen architecture pattern and folder structure
- Dependency rules (what depends on what)
- Layer/module boundaries and communication patterns
- Follow these conventions when implementing — file placement, imports, module boundaries

**Read `.ai-factory/RULES.md`** if it exists:
- These are project-specific rules and conventions added by the user
- **ALWAYS follow these rules** when implementing — they override general patterns
- Rules are short, actionable — treat each as a hard requirement

**Read all patches from `.ai-factory/patches/`** if the directory exists:
- Use `Glob` to find all `*.md` files in `.ai-factory/patches/`
- Read each patch to learn from past fixes and mistakes
- Apply lessons learned: avoid patterns that caused bugs, use patterns that prevented them
- Pay attention to **Root Cause** and **Prevention** sections — they tell you what NOT to do

**Use this context when implementing:**
- Follow the specified tech stack
- Use correct import patterns and conventions
- Apply proper error handling and logging as specified
- **Avoid pitfalls documented in patches** — don't repeat past mistakes

### Step 0.1: Find Plan File

**Check for plan files in this order:**

```
1. Check current git branch:
   git branch --show-current
   → Look for .ai-factory/plans/<branch-name>.md
     (replace / with - in branch name, e.g. feature/user-auth → feature-user-auth.md)

2. No branch-named file → List .ai-factory/plans/*.md and pick the most recently modified one.
```

**Priority:**
1. Branch-named file in `.ai-factory/plans/` — canonical location for both fast and full mode
2. Most recently modified file in `.ai-factory/plans/` — if branch name doesn't match

**Read the plan file** to understand:
- Context and settings (testing, logging preferences)
- Commit checkpoints (when to commit)
- Task dependencies

### Step 1: Load Current State

```
TaskList → Get all tasks with status
```

Find:
- Next pending task (not blocked, not completed)
- Any in_progress tasks (resume these first)

### Step 2: Display Progress

```
## Implementation Progress

✅ Completed: 3/8 tasks
🔄 In Progress: Task #4 - Implement search service
⏳ Pending: 4 tasks

Current task: #4 - Implement search service
```

### Step 3: Execute Current Task

For each task:

**3.1: Fetch full details**
```
TaskGet(taskId) → Get description, files, context
```

**3.2: Mark as in_progress**
```
TaskUpdate(taskId, status: "in_progress")
```

**3.3: Implement the task**
- Read relevant files
- Make necessary changes
- Follow existing code patterns
- **NO tests unless plan includes test tasks**
- **NO reports or summaries**

**3.4: Verify implementation**
- Check code compiles/runs
- Verify functionality works
- Fix any immediate issues

**3.5: Mark as completed**
```
TaskUpdate(taskId, status: "completed")
```

**3.6: Update checkbox in plan file**

**IMMEDIATELY** after completing a task, update the checkbox in the plan file:

```markdown
# Before
- [ ] Task 1: Create user model

# After
- [x] Task 1: Create user model
```

**This is MANDATORY** — checkboxes must reflect actual progress:
- Use `Edit` tool to change `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Do this RIGHT AFTER each task completion
- Even if deletion will be offered later
- Plan file is the source of truth for progress

**3.7: Update .ai-factory/DESCRIPTION.md if needed**

If during implementation:
- New dependency/library was added
- Tech stack changed (e.g., added Redis, switched ORM)
- New integration added (e.g., Stripe, SendGrid)
- Architecture decision was made

→ Update `.ai-factory/DESCRIPTION.md` to reflect the change:

```markdown
## Tech Stack
- **Cache:** Redis (added for session storage)
```

This keeps .ai-factory/DESCRIPTION.md as the source of truth.

**3.7.1: Update AGENTS.md and ARCHITECTURE.md if project structure changed**

If during implementation:
- New directories or modules were created
- Project structure changed significantly (new `src/modules/`, new API routes directory, etc.)
- New entry points or key files were added

→ Update `AGENTS.md` — refresh the "Project Structure" tree and "Key Entry Points" table to reflect new directories/files.

→ Update `.ai-factory/ARCHITECTURE.md` — if new modules or layers were added that should be documented in the folder structure section.

**Only update if structure actually changed** — don't rewrite on every task. Check if new directories were created that aren't in the current structure map.

**3.8: Check for commit checkpoint**

If the plan has commit checkpoints and current task is at a checkpoint:
```
✅ Tasks 1-4 completed.

This is a commit checkpoint. Ready to commit?
Suggested message: "feat: add base models and types"

- [ ] Yes, commit now (/aif-commit)
- [ ] No, continue to next task
- [ ] Skip all commit checkpoints
```

**3.9: Move to next task or pause**

### Step 4: Session Persistence

Progress is automatically saved via TaskUpdate.

**To pause:**
```
Current progress saved.

Completed: 4/8 tasks
Next task: #5 - Add pagination support

To resume later, run:
/aif-implement
```

**To resume (next session):**
```
/aif-implement
```
→ Automatically finds next incomplete task

### Step 5: Completion

When all tasks are done:

```
## Implementation Complete

All 8 tasks completed.

Branch: feature/product-search
Plan file: .ai-factory/plans/feature-product-search.md
Files modified:
- src/services/search.ts (created)
- src/api/products/search.ts (created)
- src/types/search.ts (created)

What's next?

1. 🔍 /aif-verify — Verify nothing was missed (recommended)
2. 💾 /aif-commit — Commit the changes directly
```

**Check ROADMAP.md progress:**

If `.ai-factory/ROADMAP.md` exists:
1. Read it
2. Check if the completed work corresponds to any unchecked milestone
3. If yes — mark it `[x]` and add entry to the Completed table with today's date
4. Tell the user which milestone was marked done

### Context Cleanup

Context is heavy after implementation. All code changes are saved — suggest freeing space:

```
AskUserQuestion: Free up context before continuing?

Options:
1. /clear — Full reset (recommended)
2. /compact — Compress history
3. Continue as is
```

**Suggest verification:**

```
AskUserQuestion: All tasks complete. Run verification?

Options:
1. Verify first — Run /aif-verify to check completeness (recommended)
2. Skip to commit — Go straight to /aif-commit
```

If user chooses "Verify first" → suggest invoking `/aif-verify`.
If user chooses "Skip to commit" → suggest invoking `/aif-commit`.

**Check if documentation needs updating:**

Read the plan file settings. If documentation preference is set to "yes" (from `/aif-plan full` questions), run `/aif-docs` to update documentation.

If documentation preference is "no" or not set — skip this step silently.

If documentation preference is "yes":
```
📝 Updating project documentation...
```
→ Invoke `/aif-docs` to analyze changes and update docs.

**Handle plan file after completion:**

- **If plan file in `.ai-factory/plans/`**:
  - Keep it - documents what was done
  - User can delete before merging if desired

**IMPORTANT: NO summary reports, NO analysis documents, NO wrap-up tasks.**

## Commands

### Start/Resume Implementation
```
/aif-implement
```
Continues from next incomplete task.

### Start from Specific Task
```
/aif-implement 5
```
Starts from task #5 (useful for skipping or re-doing).

### Check Status Only
```
/aif-implement status
```
Shows progress without executing.

## Execution Rules

### DO:
- ✅ Execute one task at a time
- ✅ Mark tasks in_progress before starting
- ✅ Mark tasks completed after finishing
- ✅ Follow existing code conventions
- ✅ Follow `/aif-best-practices` guidelines (naming, structure, error handling)
- ✅ Create files mentioned in task description
- ✅ Handle edge cases mentioned in task
- ✅ Stop and ask if task is unclear

### DON'T:
- ❌ Write tests (unless explicitly in task list)
- ❌ Create report files
- ❌ Create summary documents
- ❌ Add tasks not in the plan
- ❌ Skip tasks without user permission
- ❌ Mark incomplete tasks as done
- ❌ Violate `.ai-factory/ARCHITECTURE.md` conventions for file placement and module boundaries

For progress display format, blocker handling, session continuity examples, and full flow examples → see `references/IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md`

## Critical Rules

1. **NEVER write tests** unless task list explicitly includes test tasks
2. **NEVER create reports** or summary documents after completion
3. **ALWAYS mark task in_progress** before starting work
4. **ALWAYS mark task completed** after finishing
5. **ALWAYS update checkbox in plan file** - `- [ ]` → `- [x]` immediately after task completion
6. **PRESERVE progress** - tasks survive session boundaries
7. **ONE task at a time** - focus on current task only
